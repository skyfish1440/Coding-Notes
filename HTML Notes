		<!--Meta tags are tags that defines information about the data (data describing data). This one defines the charcter set. "UTF-8" is just a very common character set. It encodes the most characters in 8-bits in order to make it efficient for most data. It goes up to 32-bits for less common characters. "UTF-32" is a static 32-bits, and as Unicode only requires 21 bits to encode its limit of 1,114,112 characters, it has a number of leading zeros that pad each code. This is inefficient and makes its data in English about 4 times larger than "UTF-8" or "UTF-16" on average.-->

		<!--meta description gives a description of your website to things like Google and other web browsers. This tag is the description you read about a website when you find it on a search engine. Keep it brief or a search engine could penalize you by giving you less priority-->

		<p style="color: rgb(0, 255, 221); background-color: red;">With HTML, you can change style and color by adding attributes to a tag, but they are very basic and anything more advanced will be covered by CSS. If you use a more sophisticated text editor like Visual Studio Code, you get a sample color in the code and can move the color values on a slider.</p>
